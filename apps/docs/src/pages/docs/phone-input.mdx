# PhoneInput

**PhoneInput** is a highly customizable component with auto formatting and validating phone number.

**PhoneInput** is a very basic component which doesn't come with any styles by default.

## Install

To start using **React Awesome Phone Input**, you need to install the `@react-awesome/phone-input` library. In your project directory, run
the following command to install the dependencies:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @react-awesome/components
```

Then import it as below:

```jsx filename="home.jsx"
import { PhoneInput } from '@react-awesome/phone-input';

export const HomePage = () => <PhoneInput />;
```

### Or

Import it directly from the **React Awesome Components** package.

```jsx filename="home.jsx"
import { PhoneInput } from '@reasome/components';
```

import { PhoneInput } from '@react-awesome/phone-input';
import { Container } from '../../components/Container';
import { Preview } from '../../components/Preview';

import '@react-awesome/phone-input/dist/style.css';
